<!-- 
 Coding Challenge #1
 Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
 calculated using the formula:
 BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
 and height in meter).
 Your tasks:
 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
 versions
 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
 whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
 Test data:
 § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95m tall.
 § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

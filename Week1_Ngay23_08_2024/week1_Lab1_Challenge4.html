 Coding Challenge #4
 Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a 
 restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 
 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
 Your tasks:
 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for 
 this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement � (If it's easier for you, you can 
 start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary 
 operator!)
 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value 
 (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25”
 Test data:
 § Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
 Hints:
 § To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
 § Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300
